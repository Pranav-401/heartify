❤️ Heartify

A Vision-Based System for Early Screening and Monitoring of Chronic Disease Risk Using Emotion Analysis and rPPG Signals

📌 Overview

Heartify is a browser-based, vision-driven health screening and monitoring system designed to support early detection and continuous monitoring of chronic disease risk.

The system leverages:

Mobile camera sensors

Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)

Facial emotion analysis

to extract non-invasive physiological and psychological indicators in real time.

Heartify is intended as a pre-screening and monitoring solution, not a medical diagnostic device, and is designed to assist users and clinicians with longitudinal health insights.

🎯 Key Objectives

Enable early-stage risk screening for stress-related and chronic conditions

Provide non-contact heart rate estimation using fingertip-based rPPG

Capture emotion and stress indicators through facial analysis

Support long-term monitoring via temporal data collection

Lay the foundation for a personalized AI-powered health assistant

🧩 System Workflow

Heartify follows a deterministic, step-based health assessment flow to ensure reliability and user guidance.

Step 1 – Face Detection

Uses the front-facing camera

Detects face presence in real time

Displays live status: Face detected / Not detected

Allows progression only after successful detection

Step 2 – Fingertip rPPG Measurement

Switches to the rear camera

Activates mobile flashlight (torch) where supported

Detects finger placement using mean green channel intensity

Extracts rPPG signals to estimate heart rate (BPM)

Prevents progression if finger contact quality is insufficient

Step 3 – Results Dashboard

Displays the following outputs:

Emotion probability distribution:

sad, happy, neutral, angry, fear, disgust, surprise

Stress score

Mean green signal value

Estimated heart rate (BPM)

rPPG waveform visualization

🏗️ System Architecture
Frontend

HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript

WebRTC-based camera access

MediaPipe Face Detection

Canvas-based real-time signal visualization

Step-controlled UI logic for guided flow

Backend

FastAPI (Python)

RESTful endpoints:

/predict → Emotion and stress inference

/predict_hr → rPPG-based heart rate estimation

Modular and extensible inference pipeline

Models & Signal Processing

Facial emotion recognition using CNN / Transfer Learning

rPPG signal extraction from RGB video frames

Temporal filtering and peak detection

Stress score computation derived from emotion probabilities
